This blog talks about how to authenticate Azure Resource Manager requests through REST API using Java. All the tasks that are used to manage resources that are deployed in resource groups with the Azure Resource Manager will need to be authenticated using Azure Active Directory. There are multiple ways to setup authentication with .NET, but with java there are two ways, you can authenticate requests.

Both require that you have co-administrator access to the Azure Account and also global admin access to the active directory which we will use to make REST API requests.

You would first need to create a Service Principal with Azure Resource Manager. For this you will need to

1.  Download and configure Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell or CLI.
2.  Then follow instructions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/powershell-azure-resource-manager/) to switch to Azure Resource Manager Mode.
3.  Once you are ready to use PowerShell/CLI with Azure Active Directory, follow the steps provided [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/) to create a service principal.

Note down the ApplicationID and the password used to create the service principal. Now you will need to download multiple java modules to make this work. Here is the list:

-   ADAL for Java: This can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-java). This module has multiple dependencies, which are:
    -   oauth2-oidc-sdk (Nimbus)
    -   gson (Google)
    -   slf4j-api (Apache)
    -   httpclient (Apache)

Once you download these and configure them in build path, add this code to request access tokens from Azure Resource Management REST APIâ€™s. You can add this code into a function and call the function to return the results. Please note that there are some parameters like tenant\_id, password, client\_id, subscription\_id that will need to be replaced for this to work.

The REST API endpoints can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn948464.aspx) which can be used to manage your resources on Azure Resource Manager.
